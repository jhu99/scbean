Scbean integrates a range of models for single-cell data analysis, including dimensionality reduction, remvoing batch effects, and transferring well-annotated cell type labels from scRNA-seq to scATAC-seq and spatial resoved transcriptomics. It is efficient and scalable for large-scale datasets. Scbean will also provide more fundamental analyses for multi-modal data and spatial resoved transcriptomics in the future. The output of our integrated data can be easily used for downstream data analyses such as clustering, identification of cell subpopulations, differential gene expression, visualization using either [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/) or [Scanpy](https://scanpy-tutorials.readthedocs.io).

### Four APIs for the analysis of multi-omics data
- [DAVAE](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/23/1/bbab400/6377528?login=true) supports integration of scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, spatial transcriptomics based on domain-adversarial and variational approximation.
- [VIPCCA](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/50/4/e21/6454289?login=true) supports integration of unpaired single-cell multi-omics data, differential gene expression analysis based on non-linear canonical correlation analysis.
- [VIMCCA](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btad005/6978155) supports joint-analysis of paired multimodal single-cell data based on multi-view latent variable model.
- [VISGP](https://scbean.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/visgp_tutorial.html) supports the discovery of spatially variable genes exhibiting distinct expression patterns in spatial transcriptome data.
