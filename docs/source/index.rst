scbean
=========================================================
Scbean integrates a range of models for single-cell data analysis, including dimensionality reduction, remvoing batch effects, and transferring well-annotated cell type labels from scRNA-seq to scATAC-seq and spatial resoved transcriptomics. It is efficient and scalable for large-scale datasets.

Scbean will also provide more fundamental analyses for multi-modal data and spatial resoved transcriptomics in the future.
